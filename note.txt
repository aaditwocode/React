EPISODE 2
package-json configuretion of npm 
package-lock json conatin exact dependencies 
types of dependencies dev or normal parcel come under dev
tilde major upgrades carot minor upgrades
transitive dependencies occur when bundler like parcel most important dependencies is installed so parcel contain other dependencies it depend upon
can delete node_modules can be genrated again just by npm install command

""""
PARCEL -> hmr (hot mmodule replacemtn),build a local server,caching-faster builds,image-optimization,differential bundling->so app runs on older browesers
npx parcel build <filename> remove main from package json
dist contain producntion build and can be genrated from above command

EPISODE3
in scripts of package.json you can save for dev build "npm run start" and production build "npm run build" via keyowrds no need to write npx parcel 1.html just do hit above start one
npm run start == npm start
npm run build != npm build
JSX is not html in react its html like syntax
jsx is transpiled to make browser understand it is done by parcel(under babel dependency or package)
jsx has root,classname not class
attributes given in JSX in cameltab
if to write in multiple line wrap inside () for JSX
