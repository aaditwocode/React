EPISODE 1
crossorigin way of cdn employ in html script
react.createElement conatain type, id or class and content
reactdom.createroot and render the create element

EPISODE 2
package-json configuretion of npm 
package-lock json contain exact dependencies 
types of dependencies dev or normal parcel come under dev
tilde major upgrades, carot minor upgrades
transitive dependencies occur when bundler like parcel most important dependencies is installed so parcel contain other dependencies it depend upon
can delete node_modules can be generated again just by -(npm install)command
npx parcel <filename> parcel ignites our app on an local server
npm-> call command    npx ->to execute a package
cdn links gives react bad way , npm fetch react is a good way
install react do npm install react
install reactDOM do npm install react-dom
""""
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
after install of react from npm  just do script type=module for function
""""
PARCEL -> hmr (hot mmodule replacement),build a local server,caching-faster builds,image-optimization,differential bundling->so app runs on older browesers
npx parcel build <filename> remove main from package json
dist contain production build and can be genrated from above command

EPISODE3
in scripts of package.json you can save for dev build "npm run start" and production build "npm run build" via keyeords no need to write npx parcel 1.html just do hit above start one
npm run start == npm start
npm run build != npm build
JSX is not html in react its html like syntax
jsx is transpiled to make browser understand it is done by parcel(under babel dependency or package)
jsx has root,classname not class
attributes given in JSX in cameltab
if to write in multiple line wrap inside () for JSX
composing two component into one another->component composition
in JSX {} inside this do any js work

EPISODE4
dynamic cards-via props
config driven UI-> that ui is driven by config acc to location for diff cities carousels are different data api is the config
<RestaurantCard key={restaurant.id} resobj={restaurant} /> importance of key here is as when components of same level like diff restraunts need to be uniquely repesneted for rendering quickly 
basically needed for diffrentiaiton from one another


EPISODE5
in one file only one default export 
the other export (name export) import via {} use of this

react hooks-(normal utitlty js function)
1)use state()
2)use effect()
it quickly renders react ui component like used for filter 

1. **Reconciliation Algorithm:** React compares the virtual DOM with the actual DOM and updates only the changed parts efficiently.  

2. **Virtual DOM:** A lightweight representation of the actual DOM that helps optimize rendering performance.  

3. **Diff Algorithm:** Identifies differences between the virtual and actual DOM to update only necessary elements, improving efficiency.  

4. **React Fiber (React 16):** A reimplementation of Reactâ€™s reconciliation algorithm that enables asynchronous rendering and prioritizes updates for smoother performance.
